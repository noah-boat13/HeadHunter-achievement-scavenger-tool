# Hunter's Path

## Description

Hunter's Path is a webpage that contains a useful tool thats goal is to help gamers streamline the process of locating and completing in-game achievements. Using the RAWG API, the user can access a list of achievements for a selected video game title. Once an achievement is selected by the user, the top five most relevant youtube tutorials display as clickable cards on the page. The user can then select a video and watch on the page via a modal.

The driving motivation for the creation of this webpage was the developers' love and passion for not just playing video games, but also the hard work and time it takes to accomplish in-game challenges, whether it be their newest game or their all-time favorite title.

The developers felt inspired to create a tool that they themselves would use to enhance their own gaming experience. They were determined to do this by providing a efficent process for searching the web to find help solving an achievement, maximising their time to allow for more gaming!

This website solves the problem of the user having to visit multiple websites and/or types of media to view in game achievements and videos on how to accomplish them.

Throughout this process, our team learned how to build a website using server side and third party API’s. We learned how to dynamically update html elements within the webpage using javascript, and re-familiarlized ourselves with how to use a third party API to build the framework for our user interface.
